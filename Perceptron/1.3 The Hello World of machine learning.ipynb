    "\n",
    "<img align=\"middle\" src=\"image/traditional manner.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You express `rules` in a programming language. These act on `data` and your program provides `answers`. In the case of the activity detection, the rules (the code you wrote to define types of activities) acted upon the data (the person's movement speed) in order to find an answer -- the return value from the function for determining the activity status of the user (whether they were walking, running, biking, etc.).\n",

For example, our activity detection scenario might look like this in a machine learning context:\n",

    "Beyond being an alternative method to programming this scenario, this also gives you the ability to open up new scenarios, such as the golfing one that may not have been possible under the rules-based traditional programming approach.\n",
