## Convolutional neural network
* Convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.
* They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks (SIANN), based on their shared-weights architecture and translation invariance characteristics.
* They have applications of CNN  is 
    * Image and video recognition, 
    * Recommender systems, 
    * Image classification, 
    * Medical image analysis, 
    * Natural language processing,and 
    * Financial time series.
