A tensor is a **vector or matrix** of n-dimensions that represents all types of data. All values in a tensor hold identical data type with a known (or partially known) **shape.** The shape of the data is the dimensionality of the matrix or array.\n","\n","A tensor can be originated from the input data or the result of a computation. In TensorFlow, all the operations are conducted inside a **graph.** The graph is a set of computation that takes place successively. Each operation is called an **op node** and are connected to each other.\n","\n","The graph outlines the ops and connections between the nodes. However, it does not display the values. The edge of the nodes is the tensor, i.e., a way to populate the operation with data.\n","\n","In Machine Learning, models are feed with a list of objects called **feature vectors.** A feature vector can be of any data type. The feature vector will usually be the primary input to populate a tensor. These values will flow into an op node through the tensor and the result of this operation/computation will create a new tensor which in turn will be used in a new operation. All these operations can be viewed in the graph."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_V4SCW_9w2IB","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Representation of a Tensor**\n","\n","In TensorFlow, a tensor is a collection of feature vectors (i.e., array) of n-dimensions.

Mathematical formula or algorithm are made of a number of successive operations. A graph is a convenient way to visualize how the computations are coordinated.\n","\n","The graph shows a node and an edge. The node is the representation of a operation, i.e. the unit of computation. The edge is the tensor, it can produce a new tensor or consume the input data. It depends on the dependencies between individual operation.\n","\n","The structure of the graph connects together the operations (i.e. the nodes) and how those are operation are feed. Note that the graph does not display the output of the operations, it only helps to visualize the connection between individual operations."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"hg2HVb78k71V","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["x = tf.get_variable(\"x\", dtype=tf.int32,  initializer=tf.constant([5]))\n","z = tf.get_variable(\"z\", dtype=tf.int32,  initializer=tf.constant([6]))\n","c = tf.constant([5], name =\t\"constant\")\n","square = tf.constant([2], name =\t\"square\")\n","f = tf.multiply(x, z) + tf.pow(x, square) + z + c\t"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oPqn0u6olM7n","colab_type":"text"},"source":["**Code Explanation**\n","\n","1. x: Initialize a variable called x with a constant value of 5\n","2. z: Initialize a variable called z with a constant value of 6\n","3. c: Initialize a constant tensor called c with a constant value of 54. \n","4. square: Initialize a constant tensor called square with a constant value of 2\n","5. f: Construct the operator\n","\n","  In this example, we choose to keep the values of the variables fixed.
