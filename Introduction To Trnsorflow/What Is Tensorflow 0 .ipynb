    "##### Keras – High-Level API\n",
    "\n",
    " Keras is default High-Level API of the TensorFlow. In this article, we will use this API to build a simple neural network later, so let’s explore a little bit how it functions. Depending on the type of a problem we can use a variety of layers for the neural network that we want to build. Essentially, Keras is providing different types of layers (tensorflow.keras.layers) which we need to connect into a meaningful graph that will solve our problem. There are several ways in which we can do this API when building deep learning models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using Sequential class\n",
    "2. Using Functional API\n",
    "3. Model subclassing\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach is the simplest one. We are using Sequential class, which is actually a placeholder for layers and we add layers in the order we want to. We may want to choose this approach when we want to build neural networks in the fastest way possible. There are many types of Keras layers we can choose from, too. The most basic one and the one we are going to use in this article is called Dense. It has many options for setting the inputs, activation functions and so on. Apart from Dense, Keras API provides different types of layers for Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc. This is out of the scope of this post. So, let’s see how one can build a Neural Network using Sequential and Dense."

    "The Training Process\n",
    "The training process (happening in model.fit(...)) is really about tuning the internal variables of the networks to the best possible values, so that they can map the input to the output. This is achieved through an optimization process called Gradient Descent, which uses Numeric Analysis to find the best possible values to the internal variables of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do machine learning, you don't really need to understand these details. But for the curious: gradient descent iteratively adjusts parameters, nudging them in the correct direction a bit at a time until they reach the best values. In this case “best values” means that nudging them any more would make the model perform worse. The function that measures how good or bad the model is during each iteration is called the “loss function”, and the goal of each nudge is to “minimize the loss function.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The training process starts with a forward pass, where the input data is fed to the neural network (see Fig.1). Then the model applies its internal math on the input and internal variables to predict an answer (\"Model Predicts a Value\" in Fig. 1).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1. Forward Pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a value is predicted, the difference between that predicted value and the correct value is calculated. This difference is called the loss, and it's a measure of how well the model performed the mapping task. The value of the loss is calculated using a loss function, which we specified with the loss parameter when calling model.compile().\n",
    "\n",
    "After the loss is calculated, the internal variables (weights and biases) of all the layers of the neural network are adjusted, so as to minimize this loss — that is, to make the output value closer to the correct value (see Fig. 2).\n",

    "ReLU is a type of activation function. There several of these functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, tanh, ELU), but ReLU is used most commonly and serves as a good default. To build and use models that include ReLU, you don’t have to understand its internals. But, if you want to know more, see this article on ReLU in Deep Learning.\n",
